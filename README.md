STATUS: Work in Progress

This is currently just a placeholder! 

I am currently writing a python application that uses the confluence Rest API to extract the content from a running instance and then imports it to a bookstack instance using its Rest API.

According to https://github.com/BookStackApp/BookStack/issues/43 a real import feature for Bookstack is not planned and will not be implementet. So i want to start my own approach to transfer our valuable data to our new Bookstack instance.

Beware i just do this as a hobby. There is no guarantee that this will work in any way.
